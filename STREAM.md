# Currently working on

- Competing neural networks with different layers levels.
- Saving multiple neural structures to drive future mutations
- training the model based on a dynamic mutation factor

## how it works

Each cars compete against each other but progression saved and compared between neural network having the same amount of layers

car names are set as such:

- amount of neural layers
- neural network generation
- mutation index (0 being the original)

showing as `layers-gen-index`

### Score legend

- 👶 neural network is first generation
- 💀 car has crashed
- 📈 car has crashed with a higher score
- 💗 car is racing
- 🏆 car is besting the best score
- 👻 ghost car from a previous generation
